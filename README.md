# Bike_Buyers_data-analysis(Interactive Dashboard using MS-Excel)
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.
## Project Objective
To analyze the impact of gender, educational status and martial status on bike purchasing behaviour and identify key trends for targeted marketing strategies.
## Dataset Used
- <a href = "https://github.com/girija-2906/Bike_Buyers_data-analysis/blob/main/Excel%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset
## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the martial status of bike buyers
- What is the region of bike buyers
- What is the gender of bike buyers
- What is the average income of a bike buyers
- What is the educational status of bike buyers
- What is the commute distance of the bike buyer
- Which gender bought the bikes most.
## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format 
  and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merged all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make it dynamic.

## Project Insight
- I created pivot tables and charts to visualize the data.
- I was curious to know if commute distance was relevant to whether a bike was purchased.
- Another point of interest was whether the average income also impacted bike sales.
- This data was grouped by Gender.
- Finally, age brackets were also visualized to see its correlation with bike sales.
## Final Conclusion:
Finally, I created an interactive dashboard in Excel that includes Slicers for Marital Status, Region, and Education. These allow all the Pivot Charts to be dynamic and change upon data needs that are not directly a value on the chart.
